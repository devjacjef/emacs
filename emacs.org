#+title: devjacjef's Emacs Config
#+author: Jack Jefferson

* About

This is is my Emac's configuration primarily used for coding and writing. Each section /should/ contain a sub-heading for references as to where I sourced my information. This may prove useful to others looking to solve issues they face or be useful to me when I need to reference /things/.
I use Emac's when writing code both at work and at home and occassionally switch to other editors such as PHPStorm, Helix and Neovim. I find Emac's to be a good middle ground of powerful IDE features and simple editing.

* Config Tasks

/Tasks I am still yet to get round to./

** TODO Setup Completion

*** TODO Setup LSP Support

*** TODO Setup Minor Modes for Languages

**** TODO Go

**** TODO PHP

**** TODO Java

**** TODO Rust

**** TODO C/C++

** TODO Setup a Nice Theme

** TODO Setup Support for Docker

** TODO Setup Support for Git

** TODO Further Setup Evil

* Package Configuration

Below are all the packages I use and have configured to suit my workflow. As mentioned before, references /should/ be listed as a sub-heading amongst the source code.
I am aiming to have something fully feature, like that of an IDE.

* Setting up Package Archives

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'package)
  ;; Adding Package Archives
  (setq package-archives '(("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/")
  			 ("nongnu" . "https://elpa.nongnu.org/nongnu/")
  			 ("elpa" . "https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/")))

  ;; Init Packages
  (package-initialize)

  (unless package-archive-contents
    ;; Check for package updates
    (package-refresh-contents))
  ;; If package is not installed, install it
  (unless (package-installed-p 'use-package)
    (package-install 'use-package))
  ;; If 'use-package' is not loaded, load it
  (require 'use-package)
  ;; Always ensure a package is downloaded (avoids having to write ':ensure t' every time)
  (setq use-package-always-ensure t)
#+END_SRC

* Which Key

I keep forgetting which key I need to press.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package which-key
    :init
    (which-key-mode))
#+END_SRC

* Evil

I am more comfortable with vim bindings. They make working a lot faster.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package evil
    :init
    (setq evil-want-integration t) ;; This is optional since it's already set to t by default.
    (setq evil-want-keybinding nil)
    :config
    (evil-mode 1))

  (use-package evil-collection
    :after evil
    :config
    (evil-collection-init))
#+END_SRC

* LSP-Mode

I chose to use LSP-Mode based on what /Andrey Listopadov/ wrote about Eglot. While the post is quite old, I am sure that it's relevant in part.

  	 (lsp-mode . lsp-enable-which-key-integration))
    :config
    (setq lsp-completion-provider :none)
    :commands lsp)
#+END_SRC

* Completion at Point

This is quite an interesting topic I think. There's a lot of history as to how this is handled and I'm still quite new to it.

For my config, I am going to go with =corfu= as it seeems to be a lighter-weight solution and all I really require right now is something that let me save a few keystrokes when working.

* Snippets

Snippets are really handy to have.

* Magit

I've used magit a lot and it's one of the nicest tools I have used in Emacs.
